## Cyclone Intensity Estimation using Deep Learning


This application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading INSAT-3D IR Satellite Images of cyclones. These images are then processed by a state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow.

Our CNN model has been meticulously trained on a diverse dataset of cyclone imagery, comprising raw INSAT-3D satellite images, to accurately estimate cyclone intensity. This eliminates the need for traditional methods, ensuring precise center determination and intensity estimation directly from satellite imagery.

**Key Features:**

1. **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload INSAT-3D IR Satellite Images of cyclones directly through the intuitive interface.

2. **CNN Processing**: The uploaded images are seamlessly passed through our deep CNN model, leveraging cutting-edge TensorFlow technology.

3. **Instant Results**: Within moments, users receive real-time estimations of cyclone intensity in knots, providing swift and accurate insights.

**Benefits:**

- **Accuracy**: Our CNN model delivers highly precise estimations of cyclone intensity, surpassing traditional methods.

- **Efficiency**: By automating the intensity estimation process, users save time and resources, enabling rapid decision-making.

- **Accessibility**: The user-friendly interface makes it accessible to both experts and non-experts in cyclone tracking and analysis.

**Get Started**: Experience the power of AI-driven cyclone intensity estimation by uploading your INSAT-3D IR Satellite Images now!
